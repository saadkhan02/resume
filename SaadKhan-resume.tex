          \item Transfered knowledge to key customers regarding new redundancy
                setup that provides redundancy of RTU, IO and network.
          \item Worked with key customers to replicate field issues and wrote
                automated test scripts to make sure the bugs are resolved in
                future releases.
          \item Wrote automated scripts for testing redundancy, SIVM, NTP,
                latency and other important RTU features.
          \item Documented Design Verification Tests to test manual featues and
                then induced them into the nightly test framework.
          \item Helped in design and testing of highly available industrial
                automation network and IEDs.
          \end{itemize}
    \item \underline{\it Testing:}
          \begin{itemize}
          \item Developed and maintained nightly test framework using Perl

          \item Performed manual tests as part of release testing.
          \item Ran device verification tests and automated them as possible.
          \item Built customer specific test panels to emulate on field testing.
          \end{itemize}
    \item \underline{\it Technical support:}
          \begin{itemize}
          \item Helped customers over phone and email to deploy time and process
                critical industrial automation solutions.
          \item Helped customers with program optimization to decrease cycle
                time and overrun count.
          \item Worked closely with Engineering to resolve urgent customer
                issues.
